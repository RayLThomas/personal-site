While reworking my portfolio, I needed a 300 X 400 image of websites that I’ve worked on. This is a tedious task, but I found chrome dev tools to be the simplest approach. 

# Steps:

1. Visit your site and open chrome dev tools.
2. Click the ‘toggle device toolbar’ icon or press CTRL + SHFT + M
3. Select Dimensions > Responsive (This is the default.)
4. Enter your desired dimensions.
5. Click the 3 dots for more options
6. Click ‘Capture Screenshot’



This even names the file for you based upon the URL.
