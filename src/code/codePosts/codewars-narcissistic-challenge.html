              A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).
              <br><br>
              For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:
              <br>
              1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
              <br>
              and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:
              <br>
              1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938
              <br><br>
              The Challenge:
              <br>
              Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.

            <h2>My Solution</h2>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/RayLThomas/e023fdb147d7465a0aa20da401f66911.js"></script>
            <p>
              First, I convert the passed in number to a string. This allows me to iterate over the number to split the digits into an array. Map the
              values and use parseInt(x, 10) to convert each back to an integer.               
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Array's reduce method, we do the entire calculation in one go and simply return true or false if this new value equals the value that was originally passed in.
            </p>
